=======================

TODO:

* monitor current by checking (small resistance) resistor voltage
* monitor voltage
* high voltage capacitor in input (2x max DC input)
* supercapacitor on output as battery replacement (>50F)
* analyze maximum power by performing series of measurements of voltage and current
* 2 PWMs: charging supercapacitor/battery, heater resistor
* charge capacitor/batteries till set voltage (voltage should be changeable remotely)
* optional: third PWM to charge capacitor/batteries to charge them, something like online hybrid UPS
